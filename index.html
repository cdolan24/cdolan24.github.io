              <h2>Writing</h2>
              <p>
                Short to Long Form Stories, Game Systems (Night City Legends)

                I've always had an interest in creative writing. When I was a kid,
                I spent much of my free time writing stories of varying quality but immense length.
                When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I began to write with partners, manifesting myself as
                characters I wrote and spending hours, days, weeks, writing long stories about them.
                These characters would ultimately be the inspiration for what I animated later on, but
                developing them through stories and scripts I wrote by myself and with others would be
                especially important for building my game design knowledge. This character-centric style
                of writing and partner collaboration was a gigantic influence on how I would later design
                games. The games I write are always centered around the characters, the players, and how
                they can interact with these designed fictitous worlds.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Another big influence for me was Tabletop RPGs, or TTRPGs. Games like Dungeons and Dragons,
                Pathfinder, and especially GURPS are something that I've been playing for over a decade. I've
                been to conventions, designed homebrew for my characters, done the whole nine yards. I have
                dozens of D and D characters, but anyone can do that. What was important for me was when I
                applied the character format to other things. To the characters in the short stories I wrote.
                Breaking free of the rules of the system and creating my own, I wrote more character sheets
                than I could keep track of. But that quickly graduated into creating my own game system
                around what I knew.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Night City Legends is a text based RPG system that I wrote in inspiration from the
                Cyberpunk 2077 videogame (or at least what it was supposed to be) and the inspiration
                for the game, Cyberpunk 2020. The game is played on a Discord server that I created and
                had moderators for, but the important part of the server is the character creation system.
                Like most TTRPGs, Night City Legends revolves around building a character sheet with attributes
                and equipment and going on adventures in the world of Cyberpunk, making rolls for your abilities
                and installing cyberware to make your character more powerful. Each time you add augmentations
                to your character, though, you get one step closer to going insane, which is vitally important
                for the themes of madness and modding in the Cyberpunk IP. Night City, my character-driven RP
                system has been playtested to some extent and remains wildly fun.
