                Writing
              </h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                I've always had an interest in creative writing. When I was a kid,
                I spent much of my free time writing stories of varying quality but immense length.
                When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I began to write with partners, manifesting myself as
                characters I wrote and spending hours, days, weeks, writing long stories about them.
                These characters would ultimately be the inspiration for what I animated later on, but
                developing them through stories and scripts I wrote by myself and with others would be
                especially important for building my game design knowledge. This character-centric style
                of writing and partner collaboration was a gigantic influence on how I would later design
                games. The games I write are always centered around the characters, the players, and how
                they can interact with these designed fictitous worlds.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Another big influence for me was Tabletop RPGs, or TTRPGs. Games like Dungeons and Dragons,
                Pathfinder, and especially GURPS are something that I've been playing for over a decade. I've
                been to conventions, designed homebrew for my characters, done the whole nine yards. I have
                dozens of D and D characters, but anyone can do that. What was important for me was when I
                applied the character format to other things. To the characters in the short stories I wrote.
                Breaking free of the rules of the system and creating my own, I wrote more character sheets
                than I could keep track of. But that quickly graduated into creating my own game system
                around what I knew.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Night City Legends is a text based RPG system that I wrote in inspiration from the
                Cyberpunk 2077 videogame (or at least what it was supposed to be) and the inspiration
                for the game, Cyberpunk 2020. The game is played on a Discord server that I created and
                had moderators for, but the important part of the server is the character creation system.
                Like most TTRPGs, Night City Legends revolves around building a character sheet with attributes
                and equipment and going on adventures in the world of Cyberpunk, making rolls for your abilities
                and installing cyberware to make your character more powerful. Each time you add augmentations
                to your character, though, you get one step closer to going insane, which is vitally important
                for the themes of madness and modding in the Cyberpunk IP. Night City, my character-driven RP
                system has been playtested to some extent and remains wildly fun.

              <h2>Animation</h2>
              <p>
                Before I knew I wanted to make a game, I thought that the best way to tell some of the stories
                from one of the reoccuring worlds from my short stories would be through animations. Unfortunately,
                I had no idea how to do this. My first foray into digital storytelling was through Blender's 3D
                modeling program with a fully homemade and home-rigged model I called "Danny the Default Man",
                who I modeled a body and clothes for by hand (and it shows).

              <br>
              <p>
                Having completed my model after a few weeks of bashing my head into the wall, I decided to try
                animating this character. Unfortunately, it's now time for you to meet a good friend of mine.

              <p>
                This is Marvin. Marvin is my darling, my child, and my partner in crime. Unfortunately, Marvin
                does not really do so well when it comes to... performance, which is something that a computer
                might need when trying to render something like, I don't know, animations.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In trying to animate Danny the Default Man on his very first flight, I spent weeks wrestling
                with my computer's poor performance and my lack of skills in both animation and optimization
                at the time. The finished render was all of one frame per second (that is not a joke, the actual
                number hovered between about 0.8 and 1.1) and was a general tragedy. That being said, I learned
                a lot from this first animation, as you do when you're doing anything for the first time. I don't
                have that particular video any more, but ultimately I ended up doing a lot more animations to get
                my legs under me.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                When I began work on
                <a href="#inhuman">
                  Inhuman
                </a>
                , I wanted to learn
                at least a little bit more animation for some of the gameplay. This prompted me to approach my Cartoon
                Animation teacher and ask if I could work on 3D animations in class, which she agreed to facilitate. I
                launched into a small spree of animations both in and out of class to hone my skills, to varying degrees
                of success. Rather than using my own assets, I switched to the default Adobe Y-Bot for most of my later
                animations because it came with a rig that was much more refined than my custom rigging job.

                Some of the projects I've done were 24 hour challenges (though the time limitations were somewhat
                soft) where I would try to make the best animation possible within the set amount of time. This was
                especially convenient so I didn't spend too much time working on one thing and instead could move on
                to the next project (or homework). You can definitely see some of the performance issues in the
                computer and rendering.

              <p>
                I also spent some time working with static images and a bit of rendering to make sure I was, for
                the most part at least, not the cause of some of the rendering issues on other projects.

                I've always made films. From my inagural cinematic masterpiece of "Jetpack Dude" (age __) to
                summer camps where I did nothing but make films with my friends I've worked on a variety of
                projects where I have acted, directed, written, edited, and generally composed film for over a
                decade. While many of these films amounted to nothing, some of them served some utility. I'd say
                out of all the different angles of game design, Film and Computer Science would be my strongest
                subjects.

                I did a bit of this work professionally, actually. I have been lucky enough to work in the comic
                book industry for the last three and a half years at both the now shut down Sunset Comix and
                participated in the opening of Torpedo World, Torpedo Comics' Topanga location. Both stores
                had an active social media presence that I was frequently consulted on, given both my film
                skills and the fact that I was part of an age demographic that the storefronts were trying to
                appeal to. I made decisions about the way that both Torpedo and Sunset approached their media
                and even promoted it on my personal page to try and bring in an audience from my age category,
                which the company tried to cater to as best as possible.

              <p>
                A big part of the work that I did in the comics industry came from our transition to online
                and live sales. Sunset spent a fair amount of time streaming on an auctioning platform called
                Whatnot, where our store manager would auction comics live on camera. My job was to do essentially
                everything else, including facilitate the chat, make sure the stream was still running clearly
                and intervene when it wasn't, adjust lighting and audio (this one was especially important given
                that many of the higher value comics were in plastic covers that did not play well with any of our
                lights), and even decide where the auctioned comics would go on the back wall for the best set
                design. I took part in selling merchandise during a few of these streams to help promote them
                but my job was largely video on the fly.

                Many of these live video skills transfer over to some of the video that I'm doing today. Finding
                that being a solo developer is a lonely affair, I decided to stream some of my development process
                on
                <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cdolan24games">Twitch</a>
                to develop community, connections, and some of my game skills. This was especially challenging given
                my computer's performance and difficulty in balancing streaming with the tools I needed for development.
                You can find my very first stream VOD below.

                I used some of these skills to make small compilation reels for my own purposes. As a state
                level student-athlete, I felt that recruitment would be something I was very interested in for
                my college experience. To try and make this happen, I reached out to college coaches with a series
                of recruitment letters, all of them pointing back to an Instagram I set up
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/athlete_connor_dolan/">@athlete_connor_dolan</a>.
                This included very functional Instagram reels that were designed to showcase my progression in
                times in a professional manner and occasionally highlight some of my strongest aspects as a runner.
                I think this reel, which showcases a dominant last lap in the mile race, demonstrates what I was going
                for with this page;

                I eventually decided that I would try to learn video in a setting I could reflect on my transcript.
                I had become friends with my school's video teacher (different than the Animation teacher) when I had
                tried to use his Stage Combat mats in my training for competitive parkour as a high school sophomore.
                I ended up enrolling in that class, where I learned some of the physicality of acting, something I was
                not especially good at before. This physicality ended up going into some videos I filmed to use as
                references for animations.

                Most importantly, I think, is the fact that I just like making films. I have a lot of friends who also
                like making films. My mother is a feature film producer, my uncles are actors. I write film reviews in
                my spare time. Films are just interesting to me, so I've made a fair amount of them. Below is one of my
                favorite projects, which I did with one of my friends. We recorded footage together and decided to edit
                the footage on our own to display our different editing styles.

              <h2>Computer Science</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Computer Science. The life blood of video games. This may not have been the first way that I entered the
                game development cycle, but it quickly became the way that I want to continue up through the industry.
                When I first began to work on my project
                <a href="#inhuman">
                  Inhuman
                </a>, which became a bit of a flop for a variety of reasons,
                I spent a lot of my time coding features rather than working on things like animations, which had been
                something I was very interested in when I started the project. My focus on Computer Science in the last
                two and a half years has been explosive, and I'd like to walk through it a little bit.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                When I was first writing
                <a href="#writing">
                  text-based game systems on Discord
                </a>
                , I thought it might be interesting to have a native command for many of the randomized functions that
                you would be doing in the game. Not finding any way to do this that already existed, I decided to create
                a Discord chatbot that could handle some of these functions. Calling it Nataya, the bot was split into
                two different entities, which were TempoBot (given that my handle on a fair amount of platforms is some
                variation on the name Tempo), the bot that essentially served as my "main" branch in Github terms, and
                the ScavengerBot entity, which was more in line with my "dev" branch. To undergo such a task, I asked for
                help from my father, a mathematician and general computer-science man. He walked me through some of the
                basics of Python, which was the language that the bot was written in. The project worked to some extent,
                and was able to communicate with Discord in some capacity. The design of the bot is still mostly documented,
                but to keep the bot active would require a server that I am not currently funding.

              <br>
              <p>
                TempoBot functions were largely social, as that was what many of the people who were playtesting my system
                wanted at the time. The idea was essentially to maintain character sheets and system rules inside the bot
                and that way the system and characters could be distributed across a variety of different communities who
                might want to use the game system for their own purposes. The bot could create random names, character
                greetings, general character descriptors, and allow you to search "chests" for random drops.

              <p>
                Another small project I worked on was very different in nature. I am a
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/athlete_connor_dolan/">distance running athlete</a>
                in both Track and Field and Cross Country, and while my sport doesn't require much more than a good pair
                of running shoes, I still found myself repeatedly frustrated by the nature of many runkeeper apps. In
                distance running, one of the more popular ways to train is by doing laps around the track at a specific
                pace with a specific rest. This takes a few different forms, sometimes in longer tempo runs, sometimes in
                something called VO2 max, but the formula itself is largely the same. The issue I encountered was simply
                human error; I always forgot to turn off my watch and check the time. So I thought "what if there was a
                way to automatically stop the watch when you finished your lap?" This launched a very quick design process
                of a Samsung smartwatch application that I called "Splitkeeper". Splitkeeper was written with an API called
                Tizen, which uses C# and is designed exclusively for Samsung smart-device development, like TVs and wearables,
                which serves me and my products which are primarily Samsung. Unfortunately, Tizen has the kind of documentation
                and functionality that makes it... lets say
                <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/07/12/samsungs_tizen_no_longer_worst_ever/">"known"</a>
                among programmers, so the project has moved somewhat and as of right now is on indefinite hard-stop until my
                watch gets fixed. It was broken during a Cross Country meet and I have been unable to fix it as of right now.

                The final project I'd like to bring up is actually my most recent. When I was starting my application
                process for colleges, many of the places I was applying to wanted me to submit a portfolio, which I
                did not have on hand. So, me being me, I went through the options in my head. I could submit a bunch of
                stray files on a document next to some videos of things I've done. I could go to something like Wix and
                have a drag and drop website with everything I needed on it. Or, and hear me out, I could spend the little
                time I had on my breaks from cleaning up application essays to learn a language and an API that I was
                unfamiliar with to build a website for a simple purpose. So anyway, I learned HTML in about three hours, set
                up the Github repository, and went off. My aforementioned computer-science-man father directed me towards
                Bootstrap as I struggled with somewhat inferior systems. That repository now holds all of my scattered files
                which should be represented on this portfolio.

              <p>
                When I figured out how much I liked the Computer Science side of things, or at least scripting, I decided
                that getting more of an education than just YouTube videos might be beneficial. Most of the education I had
                in Computer Science had come from simply looking up potential solutions and documentations while stumbling
                around until I fixed most of the bugs in whatever it was that I was building. So I took steps to learn
                properly. Trying to sign up for the AP Computer Science class offered at my school, my counselor told me
                that there would be no way to take that class without dropping one of my other APs, so I settled for the
                step down: AP Computer Science Principles. I also took a community college class during the school session
                to continue the education I'd started over myself in the summer with Computer Science 101. Computer Science
                102 was a way of looking at CS to see if it was something I wanted to continue in. Next semester, I plan to
                continue with Computer Science 112, Intro to C++, which is the language that Unreal utilizes. Unreal is the
                engine that I'm spending a lot of my time in recently, so C++ feels like the best way to start on my education.
                I'm also one of the very first members of the Computer Science Club at my Eagle Rock High School and I get to
                use that platform to spend time with other likeminded people.

                And finally, the biggest part of the learning curve for my very first project
                <a href="#inhuman">
                  Inhuman
                </a>
                were the computer
                science aspects. Given that the game revolved around a variety of abilities your character could use
                and systems to change these abilities as their first priority, most of what I did on that project was
                writing scripts. Inhuman was meant to be written in the Unity Engine, which revolves around C#, so I
                spent a lot of my time writing features for the game in C# rather than working on assets. Most of where
                I ended up with Inhuman, which in theory was going to be this masterpiece with high-end graphics and
                animations that I seemed to think would just happen, actually turned out to be a handwritten controller
                moving a cube across a small city set with a bunch of crazy abilities going off on button commands. Though
                the project ultimately was a failure, I learned a lot of C# and about the process of coding within the
                framework of a game engine. One of the big lessons I learned is actually one that will make it very hard
                to display in image or video format on this page, and that is the organization of my files. Inhuman has
                two Github repositories, and I can't decide which one is messier. I will attempt to show some of the
                script files but I can't promise that they'll be elegant.

                Design Documents are interesting. Lots of people keep a sketchbook, maybe for doodling and such, but the
                notes I keep are much less about the drawings and more about the notes themselves. I'm always thinking
                up new games, new stories, and new mechanics, which I draw everywhere. Everywhere as in actually everywhere,
                from an actual notebook to some of the Samsung notes to the Discord server I use to keep notes and images.
                One time I had nothing to write on as I was thinking about a movement system so I scrawled notes all over
                my thighs, which seemed like the largest canvas at the time. For this portfolio, I will only showcase documents
                that I actually intend to use for future projects as well as some of the design documents I used for previous
                projects.

                    When I was in sophomore year, I was well into the weeds of my <a href= #animation>animation</a> journey.
                    However, part of the curriculum for the International Baccalauriate Diploma Program that our school
                    takes part in is that sophomores have to make what is called the "Personal Project". The IBDP Personal
                    Project is an assignment that, quite frankly, is easy to get away with doing something easy. So what did
                    I do?
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Lots of my friends took the easy way out. The amount of cookbooks that were made for the IBDP
                    Personal Project was truly ridiculous. But 10th grade Connor Dolan, in his infinite wisdom,
                    decided to capitalize on his animation skills that he had accrued over the 10th grade summer
                    to make a video game based on some of the <a href= #writing>stories he had written</a> over
                    the COVID-19 pandemic. This game would be an open-world superhero game similar to Sucker
                    Punch's inFamous Second Son on the PS4, which has been my favorite game since I first played
                    it at a friend's house when I was way too young to be playing M rated games. I didn't really
                    have any idea how to... yknow... build games, but I had the gifts of gumption and ignorance.

                  <p>
                    As I began to design, something I took very seriously for a project that should realistically
                    have taken me about 10 hours, my imagination, which was already slipping away from my skills,
                    really took off sprinting. I wanted to add multiplayer and
                    <a href= #computer-science>high definition graphics</a>
                    and generally create the superhero game of my dreams. I spent my mandatory gym class writing
                    on a massive design document, filling it with mechanics I wanted to add but had no idea how
                    to implement. Every video I watched to try and learn how to build a game like this told me
                    to simply not, but arrogance blinded me as I trudged forwards. Unity seemed the most accessible
                    circa 2021, even if I didn't really understand the technical limitations of engines yet, so I
                    spent a lot of time working in Unity. Rather than trying to come at the project from different
                    angles and build up gradually, I stalwartly refused to take the "easy" (smart) way through the
                    problem, which of course created problems. Messy projects, poorly written scripts, corrupt files,
                    you name it, all of this happened during the Inhuman development project. Given that my grit had
                    served me well during my nightmarish Covid-19 experience where I was forced to redo massive chunks
                    of my work throughout the semester, I trekked on, mistaking the resolve it had taken to get through
                    something outside of my control for the stubbornness it takes to not change course when the answer
                    is clearly wrong. I simply assumed my "dedication" would pay off later on.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    It didn't. My design document grew exponentially while my skills grew linearly. It made me question
                    if I even wanted to be doing this, and while I learned a lot through the process, I ultimately limped
                    across the 10th grade personal project finish line with a presentation of my design document. I had
                    learned a lot, including C#, Blender, Mixamo and other Adobe products, and Unity, but the project I
                    still consider one of my bigger failures.

                  <p>
                    The only thing that I think I did fairly well in terms of Inhuman was the design document. While the
                    game suffered from a lot of core design issues, I will say that a fair amount of the game mechanics
                    were interesting and fairly consistent. The game was meant to be about a character that was able to
                    change their powers and abilities on the fly to suit the player's specific style of play. All of this was
                    documented in a Google Site, which you can sort of see in the Presentation but I'll be sure to list down
                    below. The design document also held some of the major locations that would come into play and a lot of
                    miscellaneous design notes.

                    The design document mostly held something that I had proven I was very good at, which was story. The
                    Google Site held main story missions similar to that of inFamous, complete with character sheets and
                    powers (movesets) for many of the enemies. These character sheets and designs were massive and detailed,
                    but in the scheme of making an actual game were fairly useless. All told, the design document could be
                    classified as a small novel.

                    me into even more projects with renewed passion, hoping to one day be skilled enough to build Inhuman or
                    something like it.
